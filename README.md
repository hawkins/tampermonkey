tampermonkey
============

This repository has my personal tampermonkey scripts. They're not concerned with being brilliant or cross-system, as they're typically just scripts I throw together in a quick 5-minute session to fix small pet peeves with web pages on my desktop. Regardless, here's how to use them:

## Usage

* Each folder is a reference to where the script is helpful. I.e, "initium" folder is used for scripts for http://playinitium.com/ to modify css on the in-game chat.
* Simply follow the instructions outlined [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5258989/manually-adding-a-userscript-to-google-chrome) to install them.
